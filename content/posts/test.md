We have been instructed our entire lives on how we are supposed to behave, we have been told what we should want, how we should think, and what is true. There is nothing wrong with this. This is the appropriate model for how to raise children who grow up to be contributing members of society. We internalize these beliefs as we transition into adulthood, we soon begin to think that it is us who wants to play by the rules of the game. We adopt the same methods of collective control and brainwashing that our parents and teachers imposed on us, except we think these are our own beliefs. We decide that we must work in order to live, we decide that we must be in romantic relationships, we decide that we must obey social customs like manners, meals, and flirting, we adopt the cultural delusions that our society posits on us. We then while behaving in accordance with these cultural delusions ostracize and impose the threat of physical or intellectual violence on anyone who disobeys the norms or refuses to accept the delusions.

This is not a new mode of thought, what I have just described is at the base level, simply an explanation for modern human society. I have no problem with society as it is, I hold no ill will towards the customs of modern man, I just wish to live my life as I see fit and not be ostracized or pitied for it. There are many different forms and shapes of the human experience no more right then another, we should respect all. The issue arrises when a person, sees through the charade. When a person recognizes that what he wants is actually what he was told to want his entire life, not what he truly wants. When a person sees that blatant idiocy in societal customs and cultural delusions. When a person sees that all men are trying to fill the void caused by the absurdity of their existence, be it with food, booze, god, money, or sex. When a person sees through the charade he has two options.

I continue to play the game, knowing full well that it is not who I am and is merely a social fantasy.

Or 

I leave behind the social norms that I was raised with and I embrace who I am. 


Both choices contain an inherent existential pain.

The man who continues to play the game wearing a mask that hides who he really is simply builds up resentment towards those around him and himself. He puts on the guise of the modern man, and people respond accordingly, this is the problem people respond to him, treat him, and love him not for who he is but for who he pretends to be. He lives life in internal solitude not being able to express to those around him who he really is. Those closest to him are actually farthest from him, at least a stranger does not have the pre conceived notions of me as a normal man. He builds up existential anguish and pain until one day he snaps, he can no longer wear the mask that was constricting him, he rips it off and gasps gapingly for air. All those around him are baffled and disgusted, they say this is not the man I know! They abandon him. One can only wear the mask so close to the face so long before suffocating, and even if they have the willpower of a Saint then they merely live life in an internal solitude with no one to truly understand who they are. 


The second choice posits a twist from anguish to fear. If we embrace our eccentricities wholly and unconditionally we are then bound to be ostracized and persecuted by society. Abnormal beliefs and unique ideas even if inherently non violent in nature are perceived as a threat by the modern man. When someone sees that a person is not living life according to the cultural delusions they and their peers adhere too then that man begins to question himself. Think about how disturbed a man would feel were he to see a homeless person who actually enjoys being homeless. When men see things that contradict with their internalized view of the world they grow fearful, fearful that the rules that they allow to govern their lives may not intact be hard and fast rules. Thus the true individual is ostracized and put down. The man who is entirely open with his eccentricities lives with no anguish because he is who he truly is, yet he lives in fear due to the persecutory nature of his existence. Men are not ready to accept all forms of the human experience, in modern democratic society we are given freedom of choiceâ€¦provided we make the right choice.


So life for the eccentric man, life for the true individual who knows who he truly is, is a life where he or she has to choose between anguish or fear. We can blend in and lose our true colors, or we can stand out only to be the first to be shot.

There is a third option which I think is the most reasonable at this point in my existence. The their option is to do both. The third option is to wear the mask but keep it a healthy distance form your own face. The third option is to disguise your eccentricities not too the point where you are seen as a normal individual but to the point where you are not ostracized. This is the option i choose. I wear the mask when it needs to be worn. I am aware of my freedom i do not feel compelled to be normal, but i do choose to play by the rules enough so that I can live the kind of life I want without significant reciprocal social pressure.

I encourage every man and woman who have reached the age of maturity, to begin the process of unlearning. To begin the reversal of all they were ever taught. I encourage men and women to read for their own pleasure, to study what they want, to think long and hard about who they are. I encourage men and women to look deep within their own minds and see who they are, I encourage them to abandon all labels and the meaning attached to them. We should not even think of ourselves as men and women but rather pieces of the fragmented universal consciousness that are experiencing the colors of everyday life.

I encourage all men to find out who they are.

We are human, we are free. 




Is this all there is?
Swirling around in this abyss.
What is the point?
Why do we exist?

The drones of people.
On the commuter train.
Do they not know?
How they reign.

We exist without condition.
We are all free.
But with this knowledge.
We choose not to be.

Many a man.
Is externally defined.
Knowing the truth.
Sets free the mind.

You need not obey.
The laws of man.
You shall live life free.
Seeing beyond what they can.

For in this existence.
No man ever loses.
If would only.
Live the life he chooses.
